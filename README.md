# NOSTROMO - Launchpad Proposal for the QUBIC Blockchain

## 1. Project Overview

The **NOSTROMO** launchpad is set to become the first dedicated platform on the QUBIC blockchain, enabling new projects to initiate token sales (IDOs). As a versatile, sci-fi-inspired platform, NOSTROMO will bring a web3-based launchpad experience to QUBIC, establishing an ecosystem where projects can connect with investors and community members.

## 2. Inspiration and Concept

Named after the iconic spaceship in _Alien_, the NOSTROMO platform embodies the spirit of launching into new territories, resonating with the journey of new blockchain projects. Roles, designs, and functionalities will reflect a sci-fi aesthetic with themes of metamorphosis and space missions, capturing the essence of a launchpad as a "ship" setting off into the unknown, sometimes with surprising "passengers" along the way.

----------

## 3. Launchpad Functionality

### 3.1 Landing Page

The landing page will serve as the hub of NOSTROMO, featuring:

-   **Main Introduction**: An overview of the platform’s mission and user engagement options.
-   **Upcoming & Ongoing Pools**: Highlighted sections displaying active and upcoming token sales.
-   **Launchpad Overview**: Explanation of how the launchpad operates, benefits for project owners, and opportunities for investors.
-   **Footer**: Links to social media, contact info, terms of use, and privacy policy.

### 3.2 Project Creation

Enabling users to create and manage their token sales:

-   **Draft Mode**: Projects are first created in a “Draft” state.
-   **Approval Process**: Projects remain private until reviewed and approved by DAO members after discussion with project owners.

### 3.3 Capital Distribution for New Projects

Each project launched will allocate 5% of raised capital as follows:

-   **2.5% for Launchpad Creators**: For maintenance.
-   **2.5% for the QUBIC Ecosystem Fund**: To reinforce community support and platform growth. As the ecosystem matures, the model may incorporate buyback and burning mechanisms for public pools, leveraging Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs).

### 3.4 Tiered Participation System

A tiered system incentivizes users to stake $QUBIC for enhanced benefits:

-   **Tiered Roles**: Access to roles offering higher pool weights, reduced fees, and exclusive access based on staked amounts.
-   **Participation Fees**:
    -   **Lower Tiers**: 3% fee (1.5% to Launchpad Creators, 1.5% to the QUBIC Ecosystem Fund).
    -   **Highest Tier**: 1% fee (0.5% to each).

### 3.5 Sales Section

Users can participate in token sales by:

-   Connecting their wallets with Web3 integrations.
-   Viewing project details in a streamlined format.
-   Purchasing tokens using QUBIC or other supported tokens (USDT/USDC in the future).

### 3.6 Claim Section

A designated section allows users to claim purchased tokens and staking rewards. The claimable amount will depend on user tier level, rewarding users with higher allocations and reduced claim fees in proportion to their participation.

### 3.7 Shareholders Smart Contracts Fees

In all SmartContracts developed there will be a fee set up by a community DAO vote
